# Modeled-Digit-Predictor-
The US Postal Service has switched to automated mail sorting which uses classifiers to identify digits. The following report seeks to analyze the hand written digits and produce a model that can accurately predict what digit the writing represents. This is done through training a model using training data and K nearest neighbors, and then applying that model on test data to see how accurate it is. The KNN algorithm looks at the nearest k neighbors to a point (or multiple points). Different metrics can be used to measure the distance from a point, but for the purposes of simplicity in this report, the Euclidean distance will be used. Then the report uses a 10 fold cross validation to estimate the error rate of the model, and obtain a CV error rate.
The data set includes a vector of numbers where very 257 numbers represent a grayscale image of a scanned digit. An individual number represents one pixel, and the value of -1 corresponds to white where 1 is black. The findings of the report include which digits are most likely to be recognized/not recognized and which model fits the data with the lowest error rates.

The main.R will read the train or test text files and store them in a data frame.
